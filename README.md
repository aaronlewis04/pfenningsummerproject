Hello! This repo contains the scripts I've created analyzing single cell data from the Rada Lab and figures + links to presentations along with them.

**R Scripts**

fastqc.R has the function used to generate fastqc figures. \
NA9.R has the code for analysis done to just the NA9 sample. \
IA10.R has the code for analysis done to just the IA10 sample.\
integrated.R has code after I integrated the two datasets as well as the differential expression analysis between the two datasets :D
